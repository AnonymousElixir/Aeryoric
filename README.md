# Aeryoric

A jekyll theme made by me for <a href="https://tonic.hackclub.com/">Tonic</a> that is purple with a nice orange accent color.

## Why design it this way?
I designed aeryoric to be as minimalistic as possible while still looking nice, This allows it to be customized greatly without hassle of removing unwanted things.
